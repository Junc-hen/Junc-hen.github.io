## Abstract


Applying CNN on embedded systems is challenging due to model size limitations. Pruning and quantization can help, but are time-consuming to apply separately. Our Single-Shot Pruning and Quantization strategy addresses these issues by quantizing and pruning in a single process. We evaluated our method on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets for image classification. Our model is 69.4% smaller with little accuracy loss, and runs 6-8 times faster on NVIDIA Xavier NX hardware.
